# Grocery Store System

Welcome to the **Grocery Store System** project! This is a simple, beginner-friendly project developed as part of my learning journey in PHP development. The primary purpose of this project is to practice PHP programming concepts, database integration, and web development basics.

---

# Project Overview

The **Grocery Store System** is a web-based application designed to simulate the functionality of a grocery store. It includes features such as product listing, shopping cart management, user authentication, and basic checkout functionality. While not intended for production use, this project serves as a foundation for understanding core PHP techniques and web application workflows.

## Key Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a list of available grocery items.
- **User Authentication**: Simple login and registration functionality for users.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and view items in the cart.
- **Order Checkout**: Submit and review orders.
- **Admin Panel** (Optional): Manage products and view customer orders.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: PHP
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL (via phpMyAdmin)
- **Server**: Apache (XAMPP/WAMP recommended for local testing)

---

## Learning and Development

This project was created as a **practice project**, following various **PHP tutorials** and resources to enhance my skills in:

- PHP fundamentals (variables, loops, conditional statements, etc.)
- Form handling and validation
- CRUD operations using MySQL
- Session management and cookies
- Building a structured project directory for scalability

I actively referred to tutorials and sample projects from the web to guide the development process, applying what I learned to construct the Grocery Store System.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grocery-store-system.git
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   - Import the `grocery_store.sql` file (included in the repository) into your MySQL database.
   - Update the database connection settings in `config.php`.

3. Start your local server (XAMPP or WAMP).

4. Place the project files in the `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP) or the appropriate directory for your server.

5. Open the application in your browser:  
   ```
   http://localhost/grocery-store-system/
   ```

# Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the guidance and resources provided by online PHP tutorials and courses. Special thanks to the creators of these tutorials for helping me build this practice project step by step.
